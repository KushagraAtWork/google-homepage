Trying to make a google homepade as an assignment for theodinproject. Looks pretty horrible. 
Did my best without taking any help.

Looked normal when using live server on vscode, alignment of the search bar got messed up when i launched it with chrome alone. Looks normal on firefox. Having trouble putting footers and icons. I was able to put logo actually but i removed it because i still need to practice menus.

Ended 24/6/21
